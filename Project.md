## **Cardinal**

##### Create an app/window that allows you to input code and have it count it towards a streak.



###### Desirables

* When a day is missed the streak returns to 0
* Create a way for the streak to be repaired
* Code is needed for the streak to be continued
* Give reminders at a set time (set by user)
* Make it presentable (have a design)



###### Future Ideas

* Make it an app (find a use case for that)
* Have it check if the code is viable
